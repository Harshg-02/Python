            #   TYPECASTING
#  the conversion of one data type into other data type is known as typecasting


a="2"
b="4"
print(a+b)  
# it act like a string so its just concate two number 


a=2
b=4
print(a+b)  
# now both number is perform add operation

a="2"
b="4"
print(int(a)+int(b))
# this is type casting we convert string into inteager

# type of type casting
# 1--  Explicit type casting  --(It is done by the programmer)
# 2--  Implicit type casting  --(it is done by the compiler) -- it is done by the order of level
